API
===

Software Development Kit (SDK) for Lifecare API containing documentation, XML schemas and examples.  

We are trying to have answers to the questions we receive in the "produktinformation" and "technical description" documents. 
In cases where the we think the received questions and the answers we give is valuable as a complement to the API documentation, 
we publish these questions and answers.
